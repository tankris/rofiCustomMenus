# Rofi Custom Menus
Compilation of Custom Menus I've made using Rofi for use with my WM (Currently using DWM)

### List of Menus

Currently the following scripts have been developed:
* monitorOutputMenu - Used to switch on/off HDMI output (external monitor placed above primary monitor)

The functionality of the menu can be changed based on user's need. Run arandr ina new terminal. Make the necessary placement of change as desired. Save the file. Copy the xrandr commands and place in the respective locations in the script.


### Dependency

Just Rofi! 

To install on arch or an arch based distro, use ````sudo pacman -S rofi````

For more information on Rofi, please refer [Rofi - Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rofi)
